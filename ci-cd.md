# CI/CD - Continupus Integration and Continuous Delivery

## What is CI/CD?
**Continuous Integration** is the process of frequently building and testing new code changes.

**Continuous Delivery** is the process of deploying new versions of an application frequently.

## Software development lifecycle
- Plan

## Why Jenkins?
Jenkins facilitates CI/CD by automating the above processes for software development.

Jenkins has plugins that help it to integrate with software like GitHub and AWS.
